# Blog

!['I should buy a boat' cat meme with text 'I should write a blog'](/img/i-should-write-a-blog.jpg)

This page represents my desire to write a blog but also my lack of time or energy to actually do it.
I think that's part of the problem with blogs - you have to fall into the categories of loving to do something
(in this case programming) and loving to write about doing something. 

Only one won't cut it. As long as this message is here, there is no blog. Maybe this counts as my first post,
but a single page isn't a blog. 

I leave you with this parting thought

> "Is it better to have blogged-and-then-not-blog-for-a-year-and-a-half or to have never blogged at all?"
