Track stocks on the Investopedia platform easier with live updates from the IEX developer API.



In March of 2018 some friends and I started an investing competition through Investopedia. The UI wasn't the greatest, so I wanted to make something to get prices faster without having to refresh as well as search for stocks. Over time the allure wore off and I stopped playing, but the project lives on.
