Filter "New Releases" using the Spotify API to view and play new albums

## Genesis

I love to listen to new music while I work, but I don't enjoy listening to Spotify's playlists with new singles or trying to look
through the new releases for albums, since it's not easy to queue singles. I built this quick prototype to easily
authenticate with the Spotify API and view new albums to listen to.

## Tech

Spotify Release Filter is built with:

- React
- Semantic UI React
- Spotify API
- Netlify

## Roadmap

I am currently working on a second version of this project, tentatively named Sieve, that will add more features and
include Redux, React Router, and more features to manage releases and ensure that your favorites are always there.
