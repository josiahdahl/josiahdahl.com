# Hello!

I am a full stack web developer with a background in PHP, Node, ES6+, and TypeScript. Iâ€™ve worked with frameworks 
such as Laravel, NestJS, React, Angular, Vue, and Ionic 3.

My wife and I own and run [Apostrophe](https://www.madebyapostrophe.com), an excellent digital agency focused on serving
small and medium size companies with branding, graphic design, web development, and project management.
